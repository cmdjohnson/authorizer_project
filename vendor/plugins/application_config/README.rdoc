== application_config functionality

'application_config' eases project configuring by introducing erb enabled yaml config file in RAILS_ROOT/config folder and provides handful methods accessing config values based on current rails environment. So, you can have separate sets of configuration properties for each rails environment you use. 

== Installation

  ruby ./script/plugin install git://github.com/cleverua/application_config.git

== Default configuration file

During installation plugin will create default config in RAILS_ROOT/config/application_config.yml, it looks like the following (please note it's okay to put ERB tags in there)

  development: &defaults
    items_per_page: 25
    secure_with_basic_auth: false
    base_url: development.com
    erb_enabled_property: <%= "#{Rails.root}/something" %>
  test:
    <<: *defaults
    base_url: test.com
  production:
    <<: *defaults
    base_url: production.com

==
== Usage

You then can access those values using 'property' method:
  class FooController < ApplicationController
    def index
      @base_url = property(:base_url)
    end
  end

This will set @base_url with value 'development.com' if you run that in development environment.
